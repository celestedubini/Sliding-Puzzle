# Sliding-Puzzle

The exercise was to implement a Sliding puzzle game. I had to make use of JavaScript/TypeScript
and CSS/HTML.
## Requirements:

  - This is a bi-dimensional puzzle (4x4).
  - Each piece can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
  - At the start all pieces are scrambled.
  - Movement of a piece is just possible when there is an empty cell next to it.
  - Just one movement is possible each time.
  - Game ends when all pieces are in the right position, showing the image clearly.
  - I couldn't use jQuery!
